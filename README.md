<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Cuenta Final Project

[Cuenta](https://cuenta-final-app.herokuapp.com/ )

In the World we live in, `TIME` is of the essence. With that being said, we realized that there was a huge need for an APP to help make splitting a bill as easy as saying `SHOTS PLEASE.` 

## Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [React](https://react.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

* npm
``sh
npm install npm@latest -g
``

## Installation

1. `git clone` this repo
``sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
``
2. `cd` into it.
3. `Install` NPM packages
``sh
yarn install
``
4. `cd client && yarn install`
5. `cp .env.sample .env`

## Available build commands

- `yarn dev`: Runs BOTH your Express.JS and React developer environment locally at the same time. Any logs coming from Express will be prefaced with `[0]`, any logs from `create-react-app` will be prefaced with `[1]`.
- `yarn server`: Runs JUST your Express.JS server.
- `yarn client`: Runs JUST your front-end React app.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your local React app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## To deploy

NOTE: Heroku specifically runs `npm start`, so don't remove that from your package.json file.

- `heroku create your-app-name`
- `heroku config:set MONGODB_URL=<insertYourAtlasDbUri>`
- `git push heroku master`
